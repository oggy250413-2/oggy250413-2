Hi guys!!!
My accounts/profile pages have been targeted in an personal attack from @Oggy250413 . Recently I recovered the account.
The @Oggy250413 is not my official account. 
All of my repos are deleted. I will start in a new journey.

I will now use PGP. I will update my PGP soon. 
Note: please see the image in this repo, name start with Screenshot
